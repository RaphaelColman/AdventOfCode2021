# Advent of Code 2021

### Overview
This is inspired by mstksg's fantastic Haskell solutions found [here](URL "https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2020").

This year I'll atempt to write my thoughts on each day's solution, and why this challenge is so much fun in Haskell. You can use this repo as a starter project for writing your own solutions in Haskell as it abstracts away the slightly tricky IO/reading puzzle input from file etc.

## Getting started
See [here](URL "https://www.haskell.org/platform/") for how to install the Haskell platform.
This repo is built using [stack](URL "https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/") which you will also need to install. After that, run `stack build` to build the project.

This project uses a .env file for configuration. See `.env.example` to create your own. You can get your session key by logging into Advent of Code then inspecting your cookies. After that, the project will handle getting your puzzle input and caching it in the /res directory.

To solve a day, just open the corresponding DayX.hs file in the /solutions directory. Each solution must be of the form:
```
data AoCSolution a b c =
  MkAoCSolution
    { _parser :: Parser a
    , _part1  :: a -> b
    , _part2  :: a -> c
    }
```
See Day1.hs for an example, which has been implemented for 2020 day 1.

To run, you can use the GHCI repl. For example:
```
❯ stack ghci
Using main module: 1. Package `AdventOfCode2021' component AdventOfCode2021:exe:AdventOfCode2021-exe with main-is file: /Users/raphael.colman/Dev/AdventOfCode2021/app/Main.hs
AdventOfCode2021> initial-build-steps (lib + exe)
The following GHC options are incompatible with GHCi and have not been passed to it: -threaded
Configuring GHCi with the following packages: AdventOfCode2021
...

λ: aoc1
Part 1:
Success (Just 538464)
Part 2:
Success (Just 278783190)
Right ()

```

This is good for trialling solutions, because `:r` will reload your changes. You can also use the `printTestSolutions` function to use inputs from /res/test_inputs instead

Alternatively, you can build and run the application completely
```
❯ stack build
❯ stack exec AdventOfCode2021-exe
